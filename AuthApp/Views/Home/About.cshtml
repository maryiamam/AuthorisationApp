        In information technology, an application is the use of a technology, system, or product.
        This application was created to give authorized users a possibility to block and delete other users.

        The term application is a shorter form of application program. An application program is a program
        designed to perform a specific function directly for the user or, in some cases, for another application
        program. Examples of applications include word processors, database programs, Web browsers, development
        tools, drawing, paint, image editing programs, and communication programs. Applications use the services
        of the computer's operating system and other supporting applications. The formal requests and means of
        communicating with other programs that an application program uses is called the application program
        interface (API).

        A website, or simply site, is a collection of related web pages, including multimedia content, typically
        identified with a common domain name, and published on at least one web server. A website may be accessible
        via a public Internet Protocol (IP) network, such as the Internet, or a private local area network (LAN),
        by referencing a uniform resource locator (URL) that identifies the site.
    <p>
        Websites have many functions and
        can be used in various fashions; a website can be a personal website, a commercial website for a company,
        a government website or a non-profit organization website. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular
        topic or purpose, ranging from entertainment and social networking to providing news and education. All
        publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web, while private websites, such
        as a company's website for its employees, are typically a part of an intranet.

        Web pages, which are the
        building blocks of websites, are documents, typically composed in plain text interspersed with formatting
        instructions of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML, XHTML). They may incorporate elements from other websites
        with suitable markup anchors. Web pages are accessed and transported with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
        (HTTP), which may optionally employ encryption (HTTP Secure, HTTPS) to provide security and privacy for the
        user. The user's application, often a web browser, renders the page content according to its HTML markup
        instructions onto a display terminal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hyperlinking between web pages conveys to the reader the site structure and guides the navigation of the
        site, which often starts with a home page containing a directory of the site web content. Some websites
        require user registration or subscription to access content. Examples of subscription websites include many
        business sites, news websites, academic journal websites, gaming websites, file-sharing websites, message
        boards, web-based email, social networking websites, websites providing real-time stock market data, as well
        as sites providing various other services. As of 2016 end users can access websites on a range of devices,
        including desktop and laptop computers, tablet computers, smartphones and smart TVs.
